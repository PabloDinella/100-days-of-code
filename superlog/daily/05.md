## Day 5: April 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Wrote a simple python parser to get a json from this log.md file. Will use it to help me enhance my log :)

**Thoughts:** Was scared of not remembering how to program in python. Indeed I had to take a look over python docs and stackoverflow to remember some things, but it's always pleasing to see how comfortable is to program in python!
