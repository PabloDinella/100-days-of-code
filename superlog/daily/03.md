## Day 3: April 06, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made some refactoring on code, reducting main function and separating specific tasks across more functions.

**Thoughts:**
* Code is much more readable now. Thanks to [@MarioJuniorPro](https://twitter.com/MarioJuniorPro) (who also [joined the challenge](https://github.com/MarioJuniorPro/100-days-of-code)!) that showed me how I could improve this code.
* I feel like using twitter, this log, and committing to the repositories is to write almost the same thing 3 times.
* I need to improve this repo's README.md. Just a reminder.
