## Day 4: April 08, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started a new project that will consist on building a web page that is an enhanced versio of this log, that will include my tweets, commits and other links. Started playing around with twitter's API. Don't worry, the commited API secret keys are invalid.

**Thoughts:** Struggled a bit with twitter's API, it turns out that ```use_whitelist``` should be turned false so I don't get an unauthorized error. I also still feel excited with this challenge, despite I'm failing to do my code hour some days (I'm actually coding every other day).
